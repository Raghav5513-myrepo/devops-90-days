# Day 06 - Git, GitHub & Branching Strategy

## 📌 Topics Covered

Today I focused on understanding **Git** and **GitHub**, which are essential tools for modern DevOps workflows. I also explored how real-world projects manage their **branching strategies**.

---

### 📚 What I Learned

- **Version Control Systems (VCS)** – Helps track changes in code over time.
- **Git** – A distributed VCS that enables collaborative development.
- **GitHub** – A web-based platform built on Git. Widely used for open-source and enterprise code hosting.
- **Why GitHub is Popular** – Easy collaboration, integrations with CI/CD, issue tracking, pull requests, and more.
- **Branching Strategy** – How teams manage features, bug fixes, and releases.
  - Looked at the **Kubernetes GitHub repo** to understand real-world branching: `main`, `release`, `feature/*`, and `hotfix/*`.

### 🛠️ Mini Script

I also experimented with a small **GitHub API script** that:
- Retrieves repository and contributor info using GitHub’s REST API.
- Can be extended to interact with tools like **JIRA**, **GitLab**, and others.
