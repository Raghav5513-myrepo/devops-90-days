# Day 05 - Networking Fundamentals for DevOps

## 📌 Topics Covered

Today, I focused on learning the fundamental concepts of networking. These are crucial for understanding how systems communicate in cloud environments and DevOps pipelines.

### 🌐 Key Networking Concepts

| Concept           | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **IP Address**    | A unique identifier for a device on a network. |
| **Public IP**     | Can be accessed from the internet (external). |
| **Private IP**    | Used internally within a local network. |
| **Subnetting**    | Splits large networks into smaller, manageable segments. |
| **CIDR**          | Stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (e.g., `/24`, `/16`) – defines the range of IPs. |
| **Ports**         | Logical access points for network services (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP, Port 22 for SSH). |
| **TCP/UDP**       | Protocols used for communication. TCP is reliable, UDP is faster but less reliable. |
| **DNS**           | Domain Name System – converts domain names into IP addresses. |
| **Ping**          | Tests reachability of a device. |
| **Traceroute**    | Shows the path a packet takes to reach a destination. Useful for troubleshooting. |

## 🎯 Why This Matters in DevOps

- Networking knowledge helps in configuring cloud instances (like EC2, VPCs).
- Important for securing services, configuring firewalls, setting up monitoring tools, and managing deployments.
- Vital for working with containers (e.g., Docker networks), Kubernetes services, and CI/CD pipelines.
